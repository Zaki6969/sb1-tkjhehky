      question: "How long does the permit application process typically take?",
      answer: "The timeline varies depending on permit type and local regulations, but typically ranges from 4-12 weeks. With our guidance, we ensure all paperwork is correctly completed the first time, preventing common delays. We provide regular updates throughout the process and work to expedite where possible."
    },
    {
      question: "What ongoing support do you provide after the permit is approved?",
      answer: "Our service includes continuous support for day-to-day operations, compliance monitoring, documentation management, and business optimization advice.

      question: "What makes your service different from handling the application myself?",
      answer: "Our specialized knowledge of transport regulations and application procedures significantly increases your chance of first-time approval. We navigate complex bureaucratic processes daily, anticipate potential issues, and know exactly what authorities are looking for. This saves you time, prevents costly mistakes, and allows you to focus on running your business."
    },
    {
      question: "Is there a minimum contract period for your services?",
      answer: "We operate on a monthly service fee of â‚¬200 with no minimum contract period. You can cancel anytime with 30 days' notice. However, most clients choose to maintain our services for ongoing operational support and compliance guidance even after their permits are secured."
